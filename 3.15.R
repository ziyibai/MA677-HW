## 1. Fiji earthquakes
#Data on the magnitudes of earthquakes near Fiji are on Blackboard under the 
#Class-21 tab. Estimate the cdf F(x). Compute and plot a 95% confidence envelope
#for F. Find an approximate 95 percent confidence interval for F (4.9) âˆ’ F (4.3).

## 2. Old Faithful
#Data on eruption times and waiting times between eruptions of the old faithful 
#geyser (located in Yellowstone National Park) are posted on Blackboard under 
#the Class-21 tab. Estimate the mean waiting time and compute a standard error 
#for the estimate. Also, calculate a 90 percent confidence interval for the mean 
#waiting time. Finally, estimate the median waiting time. We will use this 
#calculation of the median in our discussions next week.

old <- read.csv("geysers.csv")

# mean & standard error
m <- mean(old$waiting)
se <- sqrt(var(old$waiting)/length(old$waiting))

# 90% CI
L <- m-1.645*se
U <- m+1.645*se

# estimate the median waiting time
F_old <- ecdf(old$waiting)
quantile(F_old,0.5)


## 3. KS problem
#Use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to test the hypothesis that the 25 values in 
#the table below form a random sample from the uniform distribution on the 
#interval [0, 1].

set.seed(1)
x <- c(0.42, 0.06, 0.88, 0.40, 0.90, 
       0.38, 0.78, 0.71, 0.57, 0.66, 
       0.48, 0.35,0.16, 0.22, 0.08,
       0.11, 0.29, 0.79, 0.75, 0.82,
       0.30, 0.23, 0.01, 0.41, 0.09)
ks.test(x,punif)

# Since p-value=0.3501, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis. The dataset given
# is not drawn from the random distribution.


# Using the table above, test the hypothesis that the 25 values are a random 
# sample from a continuous distribution with pdf:

p = function(x){
  if(x<=0.5&x>=0){
    1.5
  }
  else if (0.5<x & x<1){
    0.5
  }
  else{
    0
  }
}
ks.test(x,p)

# p-value is small enough so that we can reject the null hypothesis, the given 
# dataset is drawn from the pdf.
